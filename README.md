# Restaurant Landing Page

This project is a dynamic single-page application (SPA) for a restaurant, built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with Webpack for module bundling and development workflow.

## Features

*   **Dynamic Content Loading:** Pages (Home, Menu, About) are loaded dynamically without full page reloads, using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.
*   **Modular Structure:** JavaScript code is organized into modules for better maintainability (e.g., `homepage.js`, `menupage.js`, `aboutpage.js`, `domUtils.js`).
*   **Webpack Powered:** Uses Webpack for bundling JavaScript modules, managing assets (images, SVGs), and processing CSS. Includes a development server with live reloading.
*   **Data-Driven Content:** Menu items and special offers are populated from external JSON files (`menuItems.json`, `offersData.json`), making content updates easier.
*   **Component-Based UI (via Factory Function):** The `createElement` utility in `domUtils.js` acts as a simple factory for creating DOM elements, promoting a more structured way to build UI components.
*   **Responsive Design Elements:** While not fully detailed, the CSS structure suggests considerations for different page layouts and styling.

## Pages

*   **Homepage:** Displays a welcome message, an enticing image, and special offers.
*   **Menu Page:** Lists all available menu items with descriptions and prices, loaded from `menuItems.json`. Features a scrollable menu section.
*   **About Page:** Provides information about the restaurant, contact details, and opening hours.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML5
*   CSS3
*   JavaScript (ES6+ Modules)
*   Webpack 5
    *   `webpack-cli`

    *   `html-webpack-plugin`
    *   `style-loader`
    *   `css-loader`
    *   `html-loader`
    *   `asset/resource` for images/SVGs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd Webpack-template
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the Webpack development server with live reloading:

```bash
npm run start 
```
*(Assuming you add a "start" script to your `package.json`, e.g., `"start": "webpack serve --open"`)*

If you don't have a `start` script, you can run:
```bash
npx webpack serve --open
```

This will typically open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Building for Production

To create a production build in the `dist` folder:

```bash
npm run build
```
*(Assuming you add a "build" script to your `package.json`, e.g., `"build": "webpack"`)*

If you don't have a `build` script, you can run:
```bash
npx webpack
```

```

**Note:**
You might want to add `start` and `build` scripts to your [`package.json`](package.json) for easier project management:

````json
// filepath: package.json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    // ...existing devDependencies...
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack serve --open",
    "build": "webpack"
  }
}
